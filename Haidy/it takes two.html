    The game is a co-op, action-adventure platformer,
    with a focus on marrying the story and gameplay.
    You play as Cody and May,
    two parents that have decided to divorce.
    Of course, this upsets their daughter, Rose,
    who creates two dolls that the parents magically turn into.
    And with the guidance of a cheesy love book called Dr. Hakim…
    They have to stay together.
    I will help you fix your relationship!
    ...you now control Cody and May on this crazy ride.
    We can't reach them! We're tiny.
    The amount of variation is insane.
    There are no similar scenarios.
    Every scene is unique.
    Whatever happens in the story, will be reflected in the gameplay.
    Got it!
    ...or use them to weigh down objects and open new paths.
    Here's another example.
    This level is about finding Cody and May’s lost attraction.
    They are given pieces of a magnet as a metaphor for their attraction.
    Come on!
    Use the magnets to push and pull your way through danger.
    Another level is their relationship to time.
    Boom! </pre>
