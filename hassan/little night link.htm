   <div style="background: linear-gradient(hsl(28, 23%, 64%),#c09cd1)"> <h2><u>story</u></h2>
<p>Wear your raincoat and do not forget to eat dinner before going to bed. You may wake up one day kidnapped aboard the “Pharynx.”
The heroine of this game is a nine-year-old girl named Six. Six wakes up one night after a horrific nightmare about a woman wearing a mask, which is the terrifying place in which most of the game’s events take place. From its appearance, it appears that the pharynx is a ship whose largest part is under water, and it is subordinated to the lady. Which uses the pharynx to kidnap children from their homes for its own benefit, as will appear later.
When they are kidnapped, the children are placed on the lowest floor of the throat - where six wake up - there they are fed and given toys to play with and beds to sleep on, but the idea is to feed and fatten them so that the chef can cook them and serve them to the customers on the middle floor above the water from the throat.
</p>                          <hr>
<h2><u>dignitars</u></h2>
<p> The game developers advise not to read the characters until after completing the game because they may contain some secrets that the player must discover while playing.
</p>                      <hr>
<h3><u>The janitor</u></h3>
<p>He is the person responsible for feeding and fattening the children, as well as wrapping them and sending them to the chef, who is located on the lower floor of the throat. After a long escape, Six amputates his long hands using a large metal door. The usher or doorman is blind and short-legged, but his sense of smell is strong and his hands are long, and he generally uses six wits to escape from him.
</p>   <hr>           <hr>
<h3><u>the cook</u></h3>
<p> He is the person responsible for cooking the children after they are sent from the lower floor to the refrigeration room on the middle floor. In fact, Six discovers that there are two chefs on her way to escape, as they work opposite shifts while the other is sleeping. Six wakes him up when she tries to get the key to the kitchen door and she is finally able to escape from them. In the dishwashing room via a pull device that will eventually lead it to the upper floor.
</p>              <hr>
<h2><u>the lady of maw</u></h2>
<p>In order for Six to reach the last floor, she must exit the ship and climb from the outside to one of the openings on the upper floor. The player will also see the customers of the pharynx entering the restaurant where dinner is served. Six is ​​now trying to reach the top, fleeing from the customers who are trying to eat her when she sees her directly in order to reach the lady, who appears to be... She smashed all the mirrors on the upper floor so that she would not see her reflection, and she continues to wear a geisha mask, so her face does not reveal that the lady has a dark ability to extract the life force from the living, so she fattens the customers by feeding them children, and then extracts their lives for the sake of her immortality.
</p>          <hr>
<h2><u>six</u></h2>
<p>Many theories have emerged about the girl and her background to explain several things in the course of events, but the strongest of them is that Six is ​​the daughter of the lady who rules the pharynx, and who realized that Six is ​​more beautiful than her, so she removed her to the lower floor and smashed the mirrors on her floor so that she would not be convinced of the opposite, and the evidence is the presence of pictures of Six in the lady’s room. Which I tried to push away too.
Because of the strange hunger that keeps driving Six all the way, which eventually turns into truly bloody gluttony, the girl continues her journey. At one stage, Six eats one of the “dwarves” who tried to offer her a piece of sausage when he noticed her hunger, just as a lady eats after her defeat.
</p>      <hr>
<h3><u>nomes</u></h3>
<p> They are small creatures that appear in various aspects of the pharynx and are believed to be what remains of the souls of children who died in the pharynx. They remain afraid of anything and everything, including Six. They represent the awareness of children when they are kidnapped, so the first thing Six does when she meets them is hug them to give them reassurance, which causes... The dwarves follow her for a short period of time, but their role in the second part of the game is much more important
